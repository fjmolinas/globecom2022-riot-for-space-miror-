\begin{abstract}

Cubesat design is facilitated by the increasing availability of open source software in the domain, and a variety of low-cost hardware blueprints based on commodity microncontrollers.
We attain the rock-bottom price to reach orbit as entities which design, launch and operate cubesats started selling to multiple tenants tiny rack slots (typically 0,25U each) for low-power payloads which may be hosted on their cubesat.
The question arises of how to provide state-of-the-art security for software updates on a multi-tenant cubesat, whereby mutual trust between tenants is limited.
In this paper, we provide a case-study: ThingSat, a low-power payload we designed, currently hosted on a cubesat orbiting at 500km altitude operated by a separate entity.
We then design Cubedate, a framework for securing continuous deployment of software to be updated on orbiting multi-tenant cubesats.
We also provide a highly portable open source implementation of Cubedate, based on the IoT operating system RIOT, which we evaluate experimentally.% in the context of ThingSat.
