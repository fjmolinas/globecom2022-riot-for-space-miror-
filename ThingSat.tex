\label{sec:case-study}

\subsection{Overview}
\paragraph*{Project}: why rent space on a ThingSat
\paragraph*{Mission Goal}
\paragraph*{Broad overview of Segments}

\subsection{Architecture}
\paragraph*{Ground Segment Description}
\paragraph*{Space Segment Description}
\paragraph*{Control Segment} % Francisco: not sure if its the right name
\paragraph*{OBC \& Payload Communication Bus}
\paragraph*{Payload Description}: tenant status, energy budget, on time etc.
\paragraph*{Communication Chain}: how are new firmware, payloads delivered,
who has access, etc..
% - OBC -> SatRev controlled
% - Payload -> Full Control

\subsection{Telecommunications}
\paragraph*{link-budget Mission Control}: delivering and communicating mission
files, delivering software updates, latency, etc.
\paragraph*{link-budget Mission}: communication between OBC and Payload, payload
active time for communication with ground segments.

\subsection{Constraints}
\paragraph*{Project}: timeline for deployment, CoVID context, etc. making it impossible
to deliver a fully functional device in time. Need to update the firmware remotely
and in orbit.
