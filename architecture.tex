\section{Cubedate: Standard Security for Continuous Deployment of Low-power CubeSat Software}
\label{sec:low-power-orbital-communication-arch}

In this section we describe Cubedate, a structured approach to securing heterogeneous software updates
for in-orbit CubeSat software.

\subsection{Security Requirements}
The minimal security guarantees that we aim for with Cubedate are authenticity and integrity of software
updates delivered over the network, during the lifetime of the satellite mission (5-10 years).
%As a matter of fact, a 10 years life span is a rather long time, during which cryptographic primitives used to secure software updates may have to evolve.
Cubedate must allow for crypto agility, i.e. update the crypto primitives used to secure update to the
satellite while in operation. This need can be dictated either by cryptography's evolving state-of-the-art
(implementation/algorithm vulnerabilities are discovered) or by the need to transfer the trust anchor
to a new entity (the authorized maintainer has changed). Additional guarantees beyond authenticity/integrity
should also be possible with Cubedate, such as confidentiality, software update replay attacks, or software update mismatch attacks.

\subsection{Trust Anchor}
Our model is based on a single trust anchor: the authorized maintainer for the CubeSat hosted payload.
There is no mitigation if this trust anchor used is compromised. We thus rely on the maintainers' ability
to keep their private keys secure.  Extensions using a (hierarchical) public key infrastructure are possible
but out of scope for this paper.

\subsection{Cubedate Software Life-Cycle Phases}
The basic process we use for securing authenticity and integrity of software updates is decomposed in six phases
shown \autoref{fig:phases}. During a preliminary, pre-flight phase (\textit{Phase 0}) the authorized maintainer
for the CubeSat-hosted payload produces and flashes the payload with commissioning material:
a bootloader, the initial firmware, and authorized crypto material (a public key, and a cryptographic hash function).
Once the hosted payload is commissioned it can be sent to the CubeSat operator of installation in the CubeSat.

Once the CubeSat is in orbit, the hosted payload maintainer can trigger iterations through cycles of Phases 1-5, whereby
the authorized maintainer can build a new software update (\textit{Phase 1}), hash the update
and sign the hash (\textit{Phase 2}) then push a network transfer (PUT) towards the hosted payload
via the ground station and the OBC (\textit{Phase 3.1}). The next time it wakes up, the hosted payload can
then ping and fetch (GET) the update from the OBC (\textit{Phase 3.2}), proceed to verify the signature and the hash (\textit{Phase 4}),
and upon successful verification, install/boot the new software (\textit{Phase 5}), otherwise the update is dropped.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Supporting Network Transport Heterogeneity}
This aspect concerns \textit{Phase 3.1} and \textit{3.2} in \autoref{fig:phases}. Security guarantees on
software updates must remain valid \"end-to-end\". Depending on the use-case, \"end-to-end\" spans differently,
as depicted for example in \autoref{fig:e2e}. In the most complex case we tackle in this paper,
end-to-end means all the way from the hosted payload software maintainer to the payload hosted in orbit on the CubeSat.
Software updates may be transported over one or more network links of varying nature:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Developer to Groundstation}: Internet;
\item {\bf Groundstation to CubeSat}: UHF/VHF, LoRa...
\item {\bf Intra-CubeSat}: CAN, I2C, RS-232...
\end{itemize}

Intermittent power supply, combined with orbiting and radio range limitations impacts the intermittence of network connectivity
to/from the hosted payload: establishing a delay-tolerant path and in-network data caching might be required.
To cope with this wide variety of network paths and links (including ultra-constrained low-power elements),
different approaches can be envisioned at the network layer, the transport layer and the application layer.
Approaches span from proprietary solutions to standards such as the low-power IPv6 protocol stack (6LoWPAN,
UDP, CoAP \cite{morabito2020ietf}) or experimental stacks such as information-centric networking which benefits
from in-network caching even with small caches on microcontrollers \cite{hahm2017low}.

Nevertheless, in order to retain generality, Cubedate does not specify any particular approach at the network,
transport and application layers to enable the delivery of software updates across the network. Cubedate only aims
to guarantee end-to-end security properties for the software update binaries that are delivered, somehow, over the network.

\subsection{Supporting Updated Software Heterogeneity}
This aspect concerns both \textit{Phase 1} and \textit{Phase 5} in \autoref{fig:phases}.
As seen in \autoref{sec:thingsat-update-req}, software updates may be of various nature and size.
Cubedate aims to support the same mechanism, workflow and guarantee to update the CubeSat
(1) firmware updates, (2) mission scenario files and (3) runtime configuration files.

For this reason, we choose not to rely on specialized approaches such as DFU
(Device Firmware Update \cite{beningo2018dfu}) which assumes that the software is
firmware and that the device is connected directly via some local bus connection (e.g. USB).

Instead, we aim to combine the use of generic and standard metadata characterizing software
updates and state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives applicable on most low-power
microcontrollers and a large variety of low-power networks, as described below.

\subsection{Low-power End-to-End Security using SUIT}

Cubedate leverages the SUIT manifest~\cite{suit-manifest} which specifies a metadata
format to describe software updates. This format uses Concise Binary Object Representation
(CBOR) for data serialization, and a security wrapper which protects the metadata end-to-end,
leveraging the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specification -\ all of which are IETF
open standards for low-power communication security~\cite{tschofenig2019cyberphysical}.

The Cubedate software update binary itself can be either encapsulated in the SUIT manifest, or transferred
separately based on the URI provided in the manifest. For instance, the metadata includes a sequence number
(preventing unwanted rollbacks), the expected device type (preventing software mismatch), the SHA256 digest
of the software update binary and of the manifest, and the ed25519 digital signature of the manifest (the metadata).
As such, using Cubedate, software updates for payload hosted on CubeSats mitigate attacks including:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Tampered Software Update Attacks –} An attacker may try to update the IoT device with a
modified and intentionally flawed software image. To counter this threat, Cubedate uses digital
signatures on a hash of the image binary and the metadata to ensure integrity of both the firmware
and its metadata.
\item {\bf Unauthorized Software Update Attacks –} An unauthorized party may attempt to update the IoT
device with modified image. Using digital signatures and public key cryptography, Cubedate ensures that
only the authorized maintainer (holding the authorized private key) will be able to update the device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supporting Crypto Agility}
The first level of crypto agility enabled by Cubedate uses flexibility provided by the SUIT standard
specification: while keeping the same metadata and workflow, diverse crypto primitives backends can be
used. For instance, to upgrade from pre- to post-quantum security, digital signature performed with
ed25519 (elliptic curve crypto), can be swapped for hash-based signatures (LMS~\cite{banegas2022quantum-suit}).

The second level of crypto agility enabled by Cubedate leverages a dedicated embedded runtime architecture:
on the one hand, we place the software update manager (implementing SUIT-related operations) in the firmware image itself.
On the other hand, we perform cryptographic operations in software only.

Thus, changing the trust anchor stored is as simple as swapping a public key in the next firmware's update manager.
Authorization to update the firmware can thus be easily delegated to another maintainer,
who can take over the production and the roll out of authorized updates. Furthermore, the update manager
in the next firmware image could implement and use upgraded cryptographic primitives.

\fi

\subsection{Guarantees beyond Authenticity/Integrity}

Cubedate may also guarantee confidentiality by encrypting (optional) software updates transmitted over the network.
It is performed using the encrypt/decrypt mechanism provided by the SUIT specifications~\cite{suit-firmware-encryption},
using a symmetric cryptographic key commissioned in the update manager by the authorized maintainer.
Confidentiality can mitigate additional cyberattacks leveraging analysis of CubeSat firmware/software binaries.

Going beyond authenticity, integrity and confidentiality guarantees for software updates delivered over the network,
using Cubedate also mitigates other attacks including:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Software Update Replay Attacks –} An attacker may try to replay a valid, but old (known-to-be-flawed) software.
This threat is mitigated by using a sequence number. Cubedate uses a sequence number, which is increased with every new software update.

\item {\bf Software Update Mismatch Attacks –} An attacker may try replaying a software update that is authentic,
but for an incompatible device. Cubedate includes device-specific conditions, which can be verified before installing
a software binary, thereby preventing the device from attempting to use an incompatible software image.
\end{itemize}
