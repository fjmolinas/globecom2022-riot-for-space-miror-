\subsection{CubeSat Software Updates}
\label{sec:fu-cubesat}
\paragraph*{Microcontroller}: studies issues related to firmware updates of in
orbit satellite subsystems \cite{sunter2016updatesnano}.
\paragraph*{Linux systems}: most of the work in literature has focused on OBC firmware
updates, which tend to be linux systems. Most solutions target on-board storage
and error correction. \cite{FitzsimmonsReliableSoftwareUpdates}

\subsection{CubeSat Open Source Software}
\label{sec:open-source-cubesat}
\paragraph*{pyCube, etc.}
%\paragraph*{Architecture}
% - electronics
% - connectivity
% - payloads, obc, etc..
%\paragraph*{Context}: largely educational, learning platform

% \subsection{Cube Sat Protocol (CSP)}
% \label{sec:csp}


\subsection{ThingSat/paper contributions} 
Not only firmware updates but also isolated business
logic or software updates of individual subsystems components. Educational missions
often a small part of the business logic needs to be updated.
\paragraph*{Authenticity of Delivered updates}: as tenant, no control over deployment
chain, risk of hacking, compliance with regulations, etc.
\paragraph*{Benefits of MCU payload}: power consumption (how much
on time as a Satellite tenant).
