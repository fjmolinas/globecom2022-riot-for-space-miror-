\label{sec:background-related-work}

\subsection{CubeSat Software Updates}
\label{sec:fu-cubesat}
\textit{Microcontroller}: studies issues related to firmware updates of in orbit
satellite subsystems \cite{sunter2016updatesnano}.\\
\textit{Linux systems}: most of the work in literature has focused on OBC firmware
updates, which tend to be linux systems. Most solutions target on-board storage
and error correction. E.g.: \cite{FitzsimmonsReliableSoftwareUpdates} focuses on
reliability of updates.\\
\textit{Securing Satelites Uplink}: NUTS (NTNU Test Satellite)\cite{birkeland2014nutsoverview}
research is focused on authenticated and secure uplinks for ground-flight communication but
uses mainly symmetric cryptography. Uses CSP. Authentication is HMAC challenge
\cite{Muench2014IntegrationAV} based using timestamps \cite{bezem2013nutsAuthenticatedUplink}.
\cite{yasir2021EncryptioUnitSat} secure communication via encryption with AES, diffie-hellman
and HMAC, its tested on atmega32.\\
\textit{OTA for Educational CubeSat}\cite{maison2021otaeducubesat}: uses MD5 for
authentication based on the fact that there will be a limited amount of messages.
Does not use public key signing because it makes for messages that look like encrypted
data, frowned upon in radio-amateurs community. Modifies linker script to achieve
small firmware payloads and targeted updates.\\
\textit{Firmware Updating Systems for nanosatellites}\cite{sunter2016updatesnano}:
stm32f103, stm32217, atmega1280, msp420, using FreeRtos, TinyOS and baremetal. Focused
on retransmissions, re-ordering schemes and image backups.\\

\subsection{CubeSat Open Source Software}
\label{sec:open-source-cubesat}
\textit{pyCubed}:\cite{Holliday2019PyCubed}: OpenSource CircuitPython based CubeSat
ecosystem: hardware and software. CORTEX-M4 MCU (atsamd51). Claims to support
over the air updates, seems to be based on eval, exec(),\\
giving a kind of (powerful and dangerous) containerization.
\textit{LibreSpace}: first open source satellite with UPSat, open source pico-satellite
with Qubik. Runs on a stm32l476.\\
\textit{FloriPaSat}: archived project, FreeRTOS runs on MSP430.\\
\textit{CubesatSim}:\cite{amsatcubesat} OpenSource raspberry-pi based hardware and
software CubeSat simulator.\\
\textit{OreSat}\cite{spivey2021oresat}: OpenSource ecosystem, uses stm32f4 for OBC
and stm32f0 for most payloads, bus CAN, ChibiOS. Claims to be able to perform
firmware updates from a file, M4 is able to fee the different M0 with updates.\\
\textit{FOSSASat}: OpenSource LoRa satellite concentrator, uses a stm32l452re OBC,
Arduino based.\\

\subsection{ThingSat/paper contributions}
Not only firmware updates but also isolated business logic or software updates of
individual subsystems components. Educational missions often a small part of the
business logic needs to be updated. Standards usage.
\paragraph*{Authenticity of Delivered updates}: as tenant, no control over deployment
chain, risk of hacking, compliance with regulations, etc.
\paragraph*{Benefits of MCU payload}: power consumption (how much on time as a Satellite tenant).
\paragraph*{OpenSource}: by using an OS like RIOT its much easier to change hardware,
or test on different hardware. It allows for the ecosystem to grow and evolve.
