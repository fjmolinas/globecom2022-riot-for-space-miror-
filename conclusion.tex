\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work studied ThingSat, a use case demonstrating the increasing need for in-orbit
software updates with high security guarantees. We provide these CubeDate, a
software updates architecture leveraging open-standards and open-source, to fulfill
the security contract while keeping the barrier of entry for CubeSat projects low.
This architecture leveraged SUIT independent of used the software and hardware stack,
while proving its adequacy for a commonly seen CSP/CAN-BUS stack. We showed that
the price in memory as well as transmission overhead, is small for a medium-sized
updates (firmware) and bearable for small updates (mission-logic), with possible
further optimizations through some concessions. However, room for improvement remains
in developing open-standards (SUIT) to provide equal guarantees while trimming-down
non-critical update metadata for highly constrained links such as space-LoRa.
